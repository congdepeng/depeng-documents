# Effective Tools for increasing productivity

I think tools are very important for diary works, especially for ITer. Today I want to introduce some effective tools I used every day.



## Quick launcher
Most operations in using computer can be split into 2 steps:

   1. find
   2. action

For example, to edit a file, you need to find it firstly, then edit it.
Or you need run a program, find it in installation folder and open it.
Have you think about this, are these tedious operations full of your diary works?
Why you need to find a file or program manually without using computer itself?

Find and open file is a very common task in diary works, but it's inefficient to find a file manually.
Quick launch tools are designed for this.

[Synapse](https://launchpad.net/synapse-project) is a quick launcher that you can use to find and open documents as well as start applications,
what you need to do is just typing the name of what you want.

Synapse is developed for linux platform, the alternative tools for Windows is [Lanchy](http://www.launchy.net/), and [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) is for Mac OS.


And if you are try to find files in a terminal, you should install [bashmarks](https://github.com/huyng/bashmarks) and [Vifm](http://vifm.sourceforge.net/).
With these 2 tools, you can forget the "cd .. cd.. cd .. cd .. cd .." now.


## Clipboard Manager

Edit history is very useful when writing documents, but the Linux OS is not original support clipboard history, so we need an tool to manage the clipboard.
There are some clipboard manager for Linux:

* [Glipper](https://launchpad.net/glipper): Clipboard utility for the GNOME panel
* [Klipper](http://userbase.kde.org/Klipper): Clipboard manager for the KDE interface
* [Parcellite](http://parcellite.sourceforge.net/): Lightweight GTK+ Clipboard Manager
* [ClipIt](https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/clipit/): A fork of Parcellite which adds many bugfixes and features

Mac and Windows also have the alternative solutions:

* [Ditto](http://ditto-cp.sourceforge.net/) for Windows
* [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) for Mac OS have Clipboard History sub-function


## Auto completion and auto hotkey
How many times you types your email every day? And what about your username? If you hate repeating input, you must try:
- [AutoKey](https://code.google.com/p/autokey/) for Linux
- [AutoHotKey](http://www.autohotkey.com/) for Windows
- [TextExpander](https://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html) for Mac



## Shell
Although [Bash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) is the default shell for most of Linux, you should try and use [Zsh](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/).
There are too many [discussion](https://www.google.com.sg/search?q=bash++zsh&oq=bash++zsh&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.3879j0j4&sourceid=chrome&espv=210&es_sm=119&ie=UTF-8) about why you need to use Zsh instead of Bash.
Don't hesitate to make changes happen, follow this [instruction](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) to install and config Zsh.



## Dropdown terminal

[Guake](https://github.com/Guake/guake/) is my favorite tool at Linux, it is a dropdown terminal that make you instantly run commands
with only one hot key.


## Chrome plugins

- [Vimium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb) merge VIM into Chrome, you must have it!
- [Pocket](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pocket-formerly-read-it-l/niloccemoadcdkdjlinkgdfekeahmflj)The best way to save articles, videos and more


## Tools is a good servant but a bad master

Use tools for increasing productivity, but never to be the slave of tools.
